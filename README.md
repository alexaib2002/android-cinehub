## Project Summary

This app allows users to book films in real time. 

Users can create an account, and the app will validate their data to ensure everything is formatted properly.

Once they're inside the app, users can navigate the home screen and select the film they want to watch. They can
select the seats they would like to use with a real-time map, and once they ensure everything is correct, they can
proceed to book the film.

After finishing the booking, users can check their bookings, and get a barcode to enter the room.

## Project Organization

This project was organized so group members would be following a common Full-Stack development cycle.

The server is an actual deployment of Google FireBase, containing the schemas and required film data for the app,
while the client requests said data and presents it to the user in a friendly way.
